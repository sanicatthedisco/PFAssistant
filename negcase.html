        <h2> NEG Case </h2>
        <p> <b>Jared and I negate</b> <em> [Resolved: The United States should lift its embargo against Cuba.] </em></p>

        <p> <b>Contention One - Austerity</b></p>

	<p> According to Boughton of Duke University, it is in Cuba’s best interest to join the IMF and the World Bank, as they will provide Cuba with the monetary resources to ensure sustainable economic growth, which according to Torres of the IMF, is crucial to maintaining any social goals that Cuba reaches. Torres additionally affirms that being a member of the IMF is a prerequisite to being a member of the World Bank. However, Boughton also notes that Cuba cannot currently become a member of the IMF due to the Helms-Burton Act of 1996, an act affiliated with the embargo that says that when electing new member states to the IMF, the U.S. cannot vote affirmatively for Cuba’s entry. As the United States is a global hegemon, they already have one-fifth of the vote and many allies to ensure a halt to Cuba’s admission at every attempt. </p>

	<p> Although the IMF and the World Bank are generally viewed as beneficial, because both assist countries in economic crises to achieve their set goals for economical and social improvement, they can also be detrimental, as according to the Whirled Bank, the measures they impose on nations that have large deficits or significant economical issues that can be remarkably harmful. </p>

	<p> These measures are known as austerity measures, which according to the Economist, means cuts in social spending to reduce a country’s deficit. </p>

<p> Such measures are enormously detrimental to Cuba for two reasons. </p>

        <p> <b> First, by hurting the economy. According to Shah of Duke University, austerity measures cause the value of labor to decrease. In addition to poverty and economy deficiencies, the United Nations claims that austerity directly leads to an increase in unemployment. This is quantified by the ILO, who states that implemented austerity measures result in a 3.1% increase in unemployment per year. Zawilinski of the University of Cambridge further noted that austerity measures decrease income by 20%.</b> </p>

        <p> <b>Second, a decrease in humanitarian services. According to Ross Buckley of the University of New South Wales, austerity measures result in a steep reduction in social services, such as education and healthcare. As a report by the World Bank states, education is crucial for the growth of an economy. Additionally, Henley of the University of Cambridge quantifies that austerity measures cut healthcare spending by 40%, leading to a 200% increase in the amount of people infected by HIV.</b> </p>

        <p> <b>Contention Two - Dual Currency </b></p>

<p> Cuba currently operates on a dual currency system. Foreign and governmental trade uses the Cuban Convertible Peso, or the CUC, and the rest of Cuba uses the CUP, or the peso, including all of the people who work in the public sector, meaning that a vast majority of those that live in Cuba get paid in the peso. The current ratio is 25 pesos to one CUC, however, if the embargo ends, according to Bremmer of Stanford University, there will be a 2 billion dollar increase in FDI by the U.S. into Cuba, making the ratio between the two currencies smaller and smaller. This is because any FDI put into the Cuban economy is in the form of the CUC, which will increase the CUC’s value, but not that of the CUP, effectively devaluing it. </p>

<p> This devaluation results in two main impacts. </p>

        <p> <b>First, increased inequality. According to Van of Leiden University, currency devaluation significantly increases inequality. This is furthered by Herzer of Helmut-Schmidt University, who states that for every 1% increase in FDI, there is a 12% increase in inequality. Sherman of MIT highlights the detrimental effect that inequality has on economic growth, as he found that a 1% increase in inequality prevents economic growth levels by 10% each year.</b> </p>

        <p> <b>Second, increased poverty. According to Feinberg of Brookings Institute, the devaluation of currency leads to an increase in costs of imports, thus increasing the costs of retail goods to consumers. Razak of the University of Northern Malaysia also noted that a 10% decrease in valuation of a currency leads to a 4.2% increase in poverty. Poverty levels increasing and an increase in costs of goods together result in a downward spiral for the economy, for the government, and for the people of Cuba.</b> </p>

        <p> Thus, we negate. </p>
