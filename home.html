        <h2> AFF Case </h2>
        
        <p><b>Jared and I affirm </b><em>[Resolved: The United States should lift its embargo against Cuba.]</em> </p>

        <p> <b>Our sole contention is trade liberalization.</b> </p>

        <p>As Borg of Fordham University states, if the United States lifts its embargo against Cuba, it is inevitable that an increase in foreign direct investment, trade, and profits stemming from tourism will be observed, resulting in an increasingly liberalized economy.	</p>

        <p><b>Subpoint A - Economic Growth</b></p>

        <p>Ranis of Brandeis University explains that with increased FDI, the private sector will be of greater value, and hence, the economic growth observed will be substantial, allowing Cuba to make greater use of its workforce and other resources. </p>

        <p>In addition to trade benefits, according to the Guardian, if the embargo is lifted, an increase of 10 million tourists from the U.S. alone will visit Cuba annually. Combined with Caribbean tourism estimates, this 10 million tourist increase will result in a projected nine billion dollar GDP increase for Cuba. Green of Stanford University also stated that after the travel ban was partially lifted, there was a 40% increase in direct traffic between U.S. and Cuban airports.</p>

        <p>According to Pepper of San Francisco University, due to the restrictions of the embargo, Cuba has lost 685 million dollars annually, a substantial sum of money that is crucial to bettering Cuba’s economy and life of the Cuban people.</p> 
	
        <p><b>Subpoint B- Political Liberalization</b></p>

        <p>The Cuban sect of communism involves tight state control to be implemented, which would only be alleviated in the event that communism completely globalized. Gershman of Yale University states that an increased American influence in Cuba, as what would happen with an increase in trade liberalization, would result in a stronger base willing to convert the Cuban government to a capitalist state. Lee of Wellesley College also notes that with greater American influence, the Cubans will be less influenced by the Chinese, which would assist the country in successful reform practices, and according to Singer of MIT, there is a large probability of this reformation being successful with increased American influence. Hence, trade liberalization will lead to the downfall of the Cuban dictatorship.</p>

        <p><b>Increased trade liberalization in Cuba has four main impacts.</b> </p>

        <p><b>Firstly, bettering water supply.</b> Cueto of Dartmouth University states that 62% of the population of Cuba doesn’t currently have access to clean water. According to Thompson of Reuters, their water is commonly laden with lethal viruses, which not only hurt tourism, but take lives as well. Locay of the University of Miami continues to explain that this issue is due to the lack of funding for basic resources, such as outdated and broken equipment. A reliable clean water supply is crucial, and without it, disease spreads rapidly and it becomes exponentially more difficult to assist those in need of medical care. </p>

        <p><b>Secondly, improving infrastructure.</b> According to de Leon of Dartmouth University, currently, in Cuba, infrastructure is virtually obsolete. However, Mohammed of Reuters states that increased economic liberalization is crucial to infrastructure improvements, as with more liberalization, infrastructure spending will rise, significantly improving and strengthening the system throughout the nation. This will grant Cuban citizens access to necessary care and transportation, thus saving those who once hadn’t had access to clean water and all other necessary care and resources in times of need. </p>

        <p><b>Thirdly, relieving hunger.</b> According to Reuters, 60% of Cuba’s food comes from foreign imports. Cuba currently is undergoing a drought and additionally has very little money, and thus, will cut down on its imports in the near future. Although Cuba doesn’t release their hunger statistics, WFP statistics show that malnutrition is evident in diseases such as anaemia. The only way this very real danger of starvation of Cuban citizens can be prevented is for the economy to flourish, which would provide enough money for the nation to continue importing enough food for its population to survive and have consistent access to clean water and all other resources crucial to one’s life. </p>

        <p><b>Fourth, increasing wages.</b> According to Te Velde of the Overseas Development Institute, a 1% increase in FDI results in a 4% increase in overall wages. This is significant, as with higher wages, people have more money to purchase necessities and goods, enabling them to cycle out of poverty and into a better lifestyle. </p>


        <p><b>Thus, we affirm.</b> </p>
